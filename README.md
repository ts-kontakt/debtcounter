# debtcounter - Polish public debt counter

My attempt at Polish public debt counter

The countdown is done by setimeout called recursively.
Sometimes it can make more sense to use a recursive ``` setTimeout``` timer instead of a ```setInterval```
(although not necessarily in this case.)

It can be easily used as a paste on a page with customizable speed.
